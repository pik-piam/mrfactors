#' @title regressionsILO
#' @description Calculates regression coefficients used by calc functions for ILO data sets
#'
#' @author Debbora Leip
#' @param subtype specifies the regression type: "AgEmplShare" for a regression between the square root of the
#' share of people employed in agriculture (out of total population) and the log (base 10) of GDP pc PPP05.
#' "HourlyLaborCosts" for a regression between  mean nominal hourly labor cost per employee in
#' agriculture and GDP pc MER05.
#' @param dataVersion which version of the ILO input data and regression to use. "" for the oldest version and
#' old regression, or "monthYear" (e.g. "July23") for newer data with the new regression type
#' @param thresholdEmplShare for a certain level of GDP pc PPP, the regresion between employment share and
#' GDP pc PPP will lead to a share of 0 and which will then go up again for even higher GDP pc PPP. Therefore,
#' the employment share is kept constant after falling to this threshold.
#' @param thresholdWage  only relevant for old hourly labor cost regression: for low GDP pc MER, the regression between
#' hourly labor costs and GDP pc MER can lead to unreasonably low or even negative hourly labor costs. Therefore, we set
#' all hourly labor costs below this threshold to the threshold.
#' @param forceWageIntercept only relevant for old hourly labor cost regression: If TRUE, the wage threshold is also
#' used as intercept of the regression. If FALSE, the intercept is determined by the regression
#' @param recalculate whether regression should be read from source folder, or recalculated from scratch. Recalculation
#' can lead to new regression coefficients if data changed, and result should always be checked.
